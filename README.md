# Test - React / Redux 

Story

You are building a web service that will publish information about different events in your town (think meetup.com). 
These events can have different topics that are defined in advance.

1. Every event has a start time and date, place and list of discussion topics.
2. The user can view all events or filter them by:
    - city
    - date and range of start times
    - topic of interest
3. Users can save their filters and get back to them in the future
4. When a new event is added to the system that matches a saved filter, the user is notified immediately (if they are on the page at the time), and also by email.

Comments
Simplicity and clarity are above all. Don't forget about industry standards, good coding style and best practices.

### Project status
- Main objectives were achieved. :heavy_check_mark:
- As an extra, the project was stylized using `styled-components`. :100:
- There was some extra stuff i wanted to add to the project, but they were not a priority at the time.
